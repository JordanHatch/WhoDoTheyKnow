WhoDoTheyKnow?
===============

WhoDoTheyKnow is a web application aggregating and exposing the links between individuals in governments, the police and judiciary and those in the media, and displaying them in a way to make it much more accessible to the general public. It is being developed as a project for [Young Rewired State 2011](http://youngrewiredstate.org/).

Data
----

There are three main data sources I intend to use to initially seed the database:

* [The list of government meetings with News International](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdHZxUUtEUnRqWWxUZUwzNG9oZFJkSkE&hl=en_US#gid=0) (via The Guardian)
* [The list of David Cameron's meetings and Chequers guests](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdDRyOHctcWFpdDdFLXpYS0JIbUxkTmc&hl=en_US#gid=0) (via The Guardian)
* [Labour's disclosure of meetings with media executives](http://www.labour.org.uk/uploads/a7a9e393-20e3-e7e4-61f1-827e97d0f212.pdf)

In addition to this, new connections will be able to be submitted to the site if and when they are reported in the media - will require citations for libel reasons etc :)
